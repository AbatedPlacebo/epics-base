# EPICS-BASE (Android Configuration)
This fork is dedicated to modifying EPICS-Base for Android usage (e.g. in Termux).

The possibility of port has seen, and some details could be changed, so it would be possible to build EPICS-Base on Android.

The modification was tested only on Android 13.0 and there is no guarantee that the build will be successful for other versions.
